# Used Car Sales Dashboard
Sprint 4 Project - Vehicles App

## Summary
In this project, the first task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (data preprocessing, data visualizations, and hypothesis testing) with a dataset on car sales advertisements. The other major task of this project was to develop and deploy a web dashboard application to the cloud service, Render, so that it is accessible to the public.

## General Conclusion
While examining the data on vehicles for sale, the following was found:

Ford vehicles have a different average price that tends to be higher than other makes. It might be worth hypothesis testing with other US vehicle makes to see if their averages are different compared to other makes.
Mileage tends to be under 150k, while prices tend to be below $45k.
